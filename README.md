# igo API car-rental

A RESTFUL API built with Ruby on Rails. It uses JWT to implement Authentication & Authorization. In this project, I built a fullstack application where users can access cars and it's featured amongst the least of cars available for rent. The repo for the client app can be accessed [here](https://github.com/icebox827/igo-client)
