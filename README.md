# igo API car-rental

A RESTFUL API built with Ruby on Rails. It uses JWT to implement Authentication & Authorization. In this project, I built a fullstack application where users can access cars and it's featured amongst the least of cars available for hire. The project serves as my final capstone project at Microverse. The repo for the client app can be accessed here
